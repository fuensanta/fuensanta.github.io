<p>So here I covered the European continent, the Great Britain, Most Asia, America, Central America.. I am always on the road!</p>
<p>I proudly call myself as "global hybrid", referring to those who are always on the road. I count myself one. Born in Shanghai, China, lived in England for a year, America for two years, Italy for two months, and spent at least another one month at a different country every year, I grew to realize that the worst thing in this globalized era is when people starts socializing with the specific people with deeply-rooted steretypes.</p>
<p>Just name a few, French are not rude and arrogant; Germans are not all poker-faced; Spanish are not all thieves; Italians are not all lazy; British are not all wankers; China is not all about sweat-shop and communism; Americans are not all ignorantâ€¦.</p>
<p>You are welcome to check <a href="http://newmediaandourlife.wordpress.com/"><strong>my blogs</strong></a> for more interesting topics when I thought about during my journeys!</p>
